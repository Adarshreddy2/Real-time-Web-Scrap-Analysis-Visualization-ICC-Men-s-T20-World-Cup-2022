# Real-time-Web-Scrap-Analysis-Visualization-ICC-Men-s-T20-World-Cup-2022

## introduction 
This project scrapes fixtures, scorecards, and live match updates for the ICC Menâ€™s T20 World Cup 2022 and converts them into clean CSV datasets for exploration. It includes analysis scripts and an interactive dashboard to visualize team performance, top players, and run-rate trends in near real-time.

he analysis goes beyond general statistics by evaluating squads and optimal playing XI selections, identifying players capable of consistently contributing to high scores (180+ totals) and those who excel in defending modest targets (150 runs) under pressure.
By examining batting performance, strike rates, bowling efficiency, and match outcomes, this project uncovers the key performance trends that shape winning strategies in T20 cricket.

Using Power BI, these insights are brought to life with interactive dashboards, allowing users to explore data visually and understand the dynamics of modern T20 cricket. The project empowers fans, analysts, and strategists to appreciate not just the thrill of the game but also the science behind squad selection and match-winning tactics.
